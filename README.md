# 🖥️ SIEM Threat Detection Lab – Splunk

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio, where I set up and use a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system to collect logs, simulate attacks, and detect threats.  

For Week 1, I am using **Splunk Enterprise** to ingest logs from my own Windows system. I have also installed **Sysmon (System Monitor)** to generate detailed logs for process execution and network activity.  

This repo will be updated continuously as I progress:
- ✅ Setup of Splunk & Sysmon  
- ✅ Ingesting Windows Security + Sysmon logs  
- ⏳ Writing queries for brute-force, suspicious processes, and outbound traffic  
- ⏳ Creating dashboards & alerts  
- ⏳ Uploading screenshots of detections  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Install and configure Splunk as a SIEM.  
- Collect logs from my Windows system (Security logs + Sysmon).  
- Simulate common attack behaviors (failed logins, suspicious PowerShell, unusual outbound traffic).  
- Build detection queries and dashboards.  
- Document findings with screenshots and notes.

## 🛠️ Current Setup
- **SIEM Tool:** Splunk Enterprise 
- **Log Sources:** Windows Security Logs, Sysmon Logs  
- **System:** Windows 10  
- **Tools:** Sysmon with SwiftOnSecurity config
